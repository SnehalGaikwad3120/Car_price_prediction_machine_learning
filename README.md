# Car_price_prediction_machine_learning
The goal of the project is to predict the prices of cars using machine learning. The dataset includes various features such as car make, model, year, price, mileage, fuel type, etc. The model used for prediction is Linear Regression, which is evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.
