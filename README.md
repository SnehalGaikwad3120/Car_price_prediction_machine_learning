Project Overview:
The goal of the project is to predict the prices of cars using machine learning.

The dataset includes various features such as car make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc. The model used for prediction is Linear Regression, which is evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

Data was collected from a publicly available car dataset containing features like:
Make,Model, Year of Manufacture, Mileage, Fuel Type, Price (Target variable)
* Data Cleaning:
  Removed any rows with missing values or columns that didn’t contribute to the prediction.
  Identified and handled outliers that could distort the model.
  Ensured all categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, transmission) were properly encoded.

  * Data Preprocessing:
Label Encoding: Categorical features like "Fuel Type" were converted into numerical form using LabelEncoder.
One-Hot Encoding: Applied one-hot encoding for any categorical variables with more than two categories (if applicable).
Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical features (like year, mileage) to ensure equal weight during model training.
Splitting Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically a 70-30 or 80-20 ratio) for model validation.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations: Plots like scatter plots, box plots, and histograms were used to explore how features like "year" and 
"mileage" correlate with the target variable.

Correlation Analysis: Studied correlation matrices to understand which features have the strongest relationship with car price.
Missing Data Analysis: Ensured there were no missing values in the dataset.

* Model Initialization:

The Linear Regression model was selected for this task due to its simplicity and effectiveness in predicting continuous numerical values. The model was initialized.

 *Model Training:
 Training the Model: The Linear Regression model was trained on the training data (features like year, mileage) to predict car prices.

  * Model Evaluation:
 The model was evaluated using three key performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute errors. A lower MAE indicates better prediction accuracy.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes large errors more heavily. Lower MSE values indicate better fit.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (car price) explained by the model. 
An R² score of 67% suggests that the model explains 67% of the variance.

* Results:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 124,865.81
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 55,937,818,507.79
R² Score: 0.67903

 Conclusion:
The model explains about 67% of the variance in car prices, which is decent but could be improved.
The Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error values suggest that the model has room for improvement, 
especially for larger price predictions.
Further feature engineering, exploring other models, or hyperparameter tuning could help improve the accuracy of the predictions.
